# Tasks System

## Overview

The task system manages various types of work items including holiday requests and automated report submissions. Tasks provide a centralized way to track, assign, and complete different types of work within the company.

## Task Types

### 1. Holiday Request Tasks

- Used for time-off requests
- Requires approval from authorized users
- Shows holiday dates and duration
- Manual creation by users

### 2. Report Template Tasks

- **Automated Creation**: Generated by background worker based on report template assignments
- **Data Collection**: Users fill out custom forms to submit business data
- **Frequency-based**: Created daily, weekly, monthly, or custom intervals
- **No Approval Required**: Automatically completed when user submits data

### 3. General Tasks

- Custom tasks for various business processes
- Can be assigned to specific users
- Support different priority levels and due dates

## Report Template Tasks in Detail

### How Report Tasks Are Created

**Automatic Generation:**

- Background worker runs every 30 minutes
- Checks report template assignments
- Creates tasks for users based on frequency settings
- Each task has specific due date based on schedule

**Task Content:**

```
Title: "Complete Report: [Template Name]"
Description: [Template Description]
Type: REPORT_TASK
Due Date: [Based on frequency from start date]
Assigned To: [User from assignment]
```

### User Experience with Report Tasks

**Task Dashboard:**

- Report tasks appear alongside holiday requests
- Show template name and due date
- Display priority level (MEDIUM for most reports)
- "Fill Report" button for easy access

**Filling Out Reports:**

1. **Click "Fill Report"** - Opens custom form
2. **Complete Required Fields** - Based on template design
3. **Submit Data** - Instantly saves and completes task
4. **Analytics Updated** - Data immediately available in dashboards

### Background Worker Process

**Frequency Examples:**

- **Daily Reports**: Task created every day from start date
- **Weekly Reports**: Task created every 7 days from start date
- **Monthly Reports**: Task created every 30 days from start date

**Smart Task Creation:**

- If user is assigned a daily report starting August 23rd
- And today is August 27th
- System creates 5 tasks: 23rd, 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th
- Each with appropriate due date

**Metadata Tracking:**

```json
{
  "type": "REPORT_TASK",
  "metadata": {
    "reportTemplateId": "uuid",
    "assignmentId": "uuid"
  }
}
```

This enables:

- Linking tasks back to specific templates
- Analytics queries for completed reports
- Assignment management and tracking
